## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Blog-preview-card_frontend_project.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project is one of my first project and is one of the most basic ones of them all, teaching me about how to make responsive layouts, use flexbox properties and how to make hover states of elements as shown-
```
main {
    background-color: var(--color-White);
    padding: 17px;
    max-width: 300px;
    border-radius: 12px;
    border-color: var(--color-Black);
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 1.8px;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 0px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}

div {
    display: flex;
    vertical-align: middle;
}

.title {
    margin-top: 0;
    font-size: 21px;
}

.title:hover{
    color: var(--color-Yellow);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

### Useful resources

- [Harkirat Singh course notes](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/harkirat-singh-course_code_and_notes) - I have added notes of all lectures along with code and lecture insights of all weeks along with bonus lectures to help you all as much as I can.
- [My development code and notes](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/cwh-web-dev-playlist_code_and_notes) - These are my notes that I made while working on my development skills in initial days and did these courses. Make sure to star the repository if you like it.‚ú®üí´
